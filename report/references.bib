  abstract = "Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) flooding attacks are one of
              the biggest concerns for security professionals. DDoS flooding
              attacks are typically explicit attempts to disrupt legitimate
              users' access to services. Attackers usually gain access to a
              large number of computers by exploiting their vulnerabilities to
              set up attack armies (i.e., Botnets). Once an attack army has
              been set up, an attacker can invoke a coordinated, large-scale
              attack against one or more targets. Developing a comprehensive
              defense mechanism against identified and anticipated DDoS
              flooding attacks is a desired goal of the intrusion detection and
              prevention research community. However, the development of such a
              mechanism requires a comprehensive understanding of the problem
              and the techniques that have been used thus far in preventing,
              detecting, and responding to various DDoS flooding attacks. In
              this paper, we explore the scope of the DDoS flooding attack
              problem and attempts to combat it. We categorize the DDoS
              flooding attacks and classify existing countermeasures based on
              where and when they prevent, detect, and respond to the DDoS
              flooding attacks. Moreover, we highlight the need for a
              comprehensive distributed and collaborative defense approach. Our
              primary intention for this work is to stimulate the research
              community into developing creative, effective, efficient, and
              comprehensive prevention, detection, and response mechanisms that
              address the DDoS flooding problem before, during and after an
              actual attack.",

              services are now widespread and ever increasing. Enabling
              convenient login for legitimate users while preventing such
              attacks is a difficult problem. Automated Turing Tests (ATTs)
              continue to be an effective, easy-to-deploy approach to identify
              automated malicious login attempts with reasonable cost of
              inconvenience to users. In this paper, we discuss the inadequacy
              of existing and proposed login protocols designed to address
              large-scale online dictionary attacks (e.g., from a botnet of
              hundreds of thousands of nodes). We propose a new Password
              Guessing Resistant Protocol (PGRP), derived upon revisiting prior
              proposals designed to restrict such attacks. While PGRP limits
              the total number of login attempts from unknown remote hosts to
              as low as a single attempt per username, legitimate users in most
              cases (e.g., when attempts are made from known, frequently-used
              machines) can make several failed login attempts before being
              challenged with an ATT. We analyze the performance of PGRP with
              two real-world data sets and find it more promising than existing

  abstract      = "A partial password is a mode of password-based
                   authentication that is widely used, especially in the
                   financial sector. It is based on a challenge-response
                   protocol, where at each login attempt, a challenge
                   requesting characters from randomly selected positions of a
                   pre-shared secret is presented to the user. This model could
                   be seen as a cheap way of preventing for example a malware
                   or a key-logger installed on a user's device to learn the
                   full password in a single step. Despite of the widespread
                   adoption of this mechanism, especially by many UK banks,
                   there is limited material in the open literature. Questions
                   like how the security of the scheme varies with the sampling
                   method employed to form the challenges or what are the
                   existing server-side implementations are left unaddressed.
                   In this paper, we study questions like how the security of
                   this mechanism varies in relation to the number of
                   challenge-response pairs available to an attacker under
                   different ways of generating challenges. In addition, we
                   discuss possible server-side implementations as
                   ``unofficially'' listed in different online forums by
                   information security ex- perts. To the best of our knowledge
                   there is no formal academic literature in this direction and
                   one of the aims of this paper is to motivate other
                   researchers to study this topic.",

                used in the consumer financial sector, both online and in
                telephone banking. They provide a cheap way of providing a
                varying challenge that prevents eavesdroppers or intermediate
                systems learning a shared secret in a single step. Yet, despite
                widespread adoption among millions of consumers, this mechanism
                has had little attention in the academic literature. Answers to
                obvious questions are not clear, for example, how many

                password, or to successfully answer the next challenge? In this

                partial passwords, and investigate the security of the

                projection dictionary ranked by likelihood, and recording
                attacks which use previous information collected by an
                attacker. The combination of these techniques yields the best
