  abstract      = "A partial password is a mode of password-based
                   authentication that is widely used, especially in the
                   financial sector. It is based on a challenge-response
                   protocol, where at each login attempt, a challenge
                   requesting characters from randomly selected positions of a
                   pre-shared secret is presented to the user. This model could
                   be seen as a cheap way of preventing for example a malware
                   or a key-logger installed on a user's device to learn the
                   full password in a single step. Despite of the widespread
                   adoption of this mechanism, especially by many UK banks,
                   there is limited material in the open literature. Questions
                   like how the security of the scheme varies with the sampling
                   method employed to form the challenges or what are the
                   existing server-side implementations are left unaddressed.
                   In this paper, we study questions like how the security of
                   this mechanism varies in relation to the number of
                   challenge-response pairs available to an attacker under
                   different ways of generating challenges. In addition, we
                   discuss possible server-side implementations as
                   ``unofficially'' listed in different online forums by
                   information security ex- perts. To the best of our knowledge
                   there is no formal academic literature in this direction and
                   one of the aims of this paper is to motivate other
                   researchers to study this topic.",

                full password, posed as a challenge such as ``Give me letters
                2, 3 and 6 from your password''. Partial passwords are commonly
                used in the consumer financial sector, both online and in
                telephone banking. They provide a cheap way of providing a
                varying challenge that prevents eavesdroppers or intermediate
                systems learning a shared secret in a single step. Yet, despite
                widespread adoption among millions of consumers, this mechanism
                has had little attention in the academic literature. Answers to
                obvious questions are not clear, for example, how many
                observations are needed for an attacker to learn the complete
                password, or to successfully answer the next challenge? In this
                paper we survey a number of online banking implementations of
                partial passwords, and investigate the security of the
                mechanism. In particular, we look at guessing attacks with a
                projection dictionary ranked by likelihood, and recording
                attacks which use previous information collected by an
                attacker. The combination of these techniques yields the best
                attack on partial passwords.",

              services are now widespread and ever increasing. Enabling
              convenient login for legitimate users while preventing such
              attacks is a difficult problem. Automated Turing Tests (ATTs)
              continue to be an effective, easy-to-deploy approach to identify
              automated malicious login attempts with reasonable cost of
              inconvenience to users. In this paper, we discuss the inadequacy
              of existing and proposed login protocols designed to address
              large-scale online dictionary attacks (e.g., from a botnet of
              hundreds of thousands of nodes). We propose a new Password
              Guessing Resistant Protocol (PGRP), derived upon revisiting prior
              proposals designed to restrict such attacks. While PGRP limits
              the total number of login attempts from unknown remote hosts to
              as low as a single attempt per username, legitimate users in most
              cases (e.g., when attempts are made from known, frequently-used
              machines) can make several failed login attempts before being
              challenged with an ATT. We analyze the performance of PGRP with
              two real-world data sets and find it more promising than existing
